## Project Overview

SmartMatch is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to streamline the process of matching students with mentors and clients with solicitors, ensuring tailored guidance and legal assistance.

For students, SmartMatch provides a seamless way to connect with suitable mentors based on their academic background, career goals, and personal preferences. The platform offers educational resources, time management tools, and mental well-being support to help ease the transition into higher education.

For clients, SmartMatch simplifies the process of finding the right solicitor by using a client allocation algorithm that considers the client’s legal needs and the solicitor’s expertise. The platform integrates a case management system (CMS) to help legal professionals efficiently organize and manage their caseloads.
