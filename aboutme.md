## Project Motivation

I wanted to develop a system that helped students through a difficult transitional period in their lives.
Moving from secondary school to Higher Education presents many new experiences that
can be overwhelming, and I have faced some of these challenges and a system that
provides not only guidance/information on fundamental aspects needed to succeed in
college, but also provides one-to-one support from mentors and methods to support
time management skills, would be extremely beneficial.

Additionally, I wanted a project that encompasses as
many technologies as possible as this allows me to demonstrate the knowledge I have
gained throughout my time in college. The legal side of my project requires different
services to support it and in turn requires different design implementations which I think
helped expand the technical side of my project.
